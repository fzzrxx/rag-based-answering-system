# RAG-Based Answering System

This is a work-in-progress project that implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using LLMs. The goal is to build a system that can answer user queries by retrieving relevant context from documents and generating informed responses.

More updates, documentation, and examples will be added as the project develops.
